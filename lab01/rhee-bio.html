    <body>
        Hello, I am Joyce Rhee. I am an Information Management and Technology major interested in UI/UX design as well as web development. I was previously a computer science major in the school of ECS, but I switched to the iSchool after the Spring 2024 semester. I have experience in some coding languages such as python, html, and javascript. Outside of school, my hobbies include listening to music, shopping, and gyming. Currently, my favorite songs include Ivy by Frank Ocean and Always and Daniel Caesar. My favorite movies are the Men in Black and Back to the Future trilogies. I have an older brother who is currently a freshman in law school. My worst fear is open fractures. And my favorite color is pink!
